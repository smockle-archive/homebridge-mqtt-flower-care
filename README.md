## About

The [Huahuacaocao Flower Care Smart Monitor](https://www.huahuacaocao.com/product?locale=en-US) (sometimes labelled Xiaomi or Mi Flora) can report temperature, sunlight intensity, soil moisture, soil fertility and battery status over Bluetooth Low Energy.

[homebridge-mi-flower-care](https://github.com/honkmaster/homebridge-mi-flower-care) can read this data over Bluetooth and report it to HomeKit. It seems like a really neat project, and you should check it out.

I wanted something a little different though. Bluetooth Low Energy has limited range, and I wanted 24/7 access to the latest sensor data. I discovered [Xiaomi Mi Flora Plant Sensor MQTT Client/Daemon](https://github.com/ThomDietrich/miflora-mqtt-daemon) can publish to an an [AWS IoT MQTT broker](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iot/home) and started work on this project.

**homebridge-mqtt-flower-care** subscribes to an AWS IoT MQTT broker and uses [Homebridge](https://github.com/nfarina/homebridge) to present Flower Care data as HomeKit sensors.

## Setup: AWS IoT

NB: This costs money. Here is the [pricing for AWS IoT Core](https://aws.amazon.com/iot-core/pricing/).

1. Create a Thing, e.g. ‚ÄúAloe Plant‚Äù

2. Create a ThingType, e.g. ‚ÄúFlowerCareSensor‚Äù

3. Create a certificate, public & private key.

4. Activate the certificate. Attach it to the Thing.

5. Create a policy. Attach it to the certificate. Here is a sample:

```JSON
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": "iot:*",
      "Resource": "arn:aws:iot:us-east-1:*:*"
    }
  ]
}
```

## Setup: Local

1. Clone this repostitory:

```Bash
$ git clone https://github.com/smockle/homebridge-mqtt-flower-care
```

2. Download the certificate, public & private key, and [Amazon Root CA](https://www.amazontrust.com/repository/AmazonRootCA1.pem). Move them to the `certificates` directory.

3. Create a `.env` file based on `.env.example`:

- `KEY_PATH`: relative path to the `.pem.key` file
- `CERT_PATH`: relative path to the `.pem.crt` file
- `CA_PATH`: relative path to the `AmazonRootCA1.pem` file
- `CLIENT_ID`: the ARN of your Thing
- `HOST`: the URL of your AWS IoT MQTT broker
